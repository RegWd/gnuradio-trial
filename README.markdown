# What is this?

GNURadio is the toolkit that treats realtime signal processing used
for composing Software Defined Radio (SDR). I just had tried to use
gnuradio in these days and could have some experiences. I thought this
experience is valuable for newbies of gnuradio, so I started to share
some knowledge about gnuradio here.

This folder contains a number of trivial samples of gnuradio.
